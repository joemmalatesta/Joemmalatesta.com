2022, as I recounted last year, was the year of firsts. It‚Äôs unlucky that I used that line last year because I would say 2023 was likewise a year of firsts. Honestly, I imagine and hope that each year moving forward will be a year of firsts. I hope I never get complacent to a point where I have nothing cool to look back on come the new year. Anyway, I made some promises to myself on the first day of 2023 so lets see if I stuck to them over the last year.

## Did I keep my promises?

In my blog, [Tech I‚Äôm taking with me in 2023](https://joemmalatesta.com/blog/programming/2023-tech), I noted that I wanted to double down on some great tech I had tried, and dive into some new tech I thought was interesting or was recommended to me. It‚Äôs safe to say that I may have set the bar a little bit low. Firstly, yes - I stuck to my promises and went in depth with each technology I said I wanted to use. I made several projects with SvelteKit and got super comfortable with Tailwind. These two tools are now the basis for each of my full stack projects and helped me [win my very first hackathon](https://twitter.com/_JoeMalatesta/status/1716219202787262813)! My two main projects of the year surrounded the other technologies I mentioned, with [Groople](https://groople.xyz) heavily relying on ChatGPT‚Äôs API and [WakeMate](https://wakemate.joemmalatesta.com) being built on Twilio‚Äôs texting and calling capabilities.

## What else did I do this year?

This year was much more than just the technology. While 2022 was mainly focused on learning and understanding programming in a purely technical sense, 2023 was far more about the application of these tools and the interaction with the communities surrounding them. 

#### <ins>Community / GrizzHacks</ins>

This year, I got a closer look at the people building and innovating in all sorts of spaces. I made a Twitter account in April to share what I was building. Turns out, there are hundreds of others doing the exact same thing and I was lucky enough to connect with several individuals building amazing products this year. In addition, I got an inside look at the people leading tech communities in Michigan. In October, I got the idea to bring back my schools yearly Hackathon after a two year hiatus, and on March 9th, 2024, [GrizzHacks](https://grizzhacks.org) will be coming back to Oakland University for it‚Äôs 6th iteration. 2023 was the first year I put myself out in the tech community and it has become one of the driving factors for continuing my development journey.

#### <ins>Internships</ins>

2022 came with my very first technical job and the beginning of my first internship. 2023 was about figuring out what I want and what I want to avoid when I get my first job out of college. I‚Äôm incredibly fortunate to have had 3 internships throughout college with varying sizes and responsibilities. I‚Äôve developed proof of concept software with a team of 2, maintained an enterprise codebase with a hundred contributors, and in 2024 I will be more community focused with my final internship being in developer relations. I‚Äôve liked and disliked things about each, but I‚Äôm certain my breadth of experience will lend a hand when I‚Äôm looking for my first full time job.

#### <ins>Groople</ins>

What started as me remaking a design for a game I liked turned into my first project with real users. I‚Äôve made plenty of personal projects before, but [Groople](https://groople.xyz) was the first time I felt true ownership for something I created. The ability to iterate on community feedback as opposed to just sending my commits to the void is an amazing feeling that I‚Äôve come to love. Groople was a great introduction into what it takes to create a product people want to use, find the people that want to use it, and get the product into their hands. The creation of Groople served me in more ways than I knew existed but I know I need to move on in the new year.

#### <ins>6 months of code</ins>

This year came with meticulous habit formation and forced diligence in many different ways. One of which was ensuring I did some sort of coding or writing each day. While a green dot every day does not directly indicate progress, it certainly does indicate the formation of a habit. Working towards a new feature or blog post every single day, no matter how small, helped me build a strong foundation for building projects and creating content. While some of the commits were forced during times I really should not have been coding, I would like to bring this back in some form next year.

## Next Year

When I made my predictions last year, I only took into account the technologies I wanted to learn and not necessarily how I wanted to apply them. In 2024, I‚Äôm focusing more on the application of technology and the exchange of knowledge rather than my own personal exploration. 

#### <ins>Graduation</ins>

Enough said... I really gotta fuck something up to not graduate next year. My genuine interest and previous self exploration in programming has made completing my classes super easy so this should be a given (big moment for my mom though!).

#### <ins>My first internet dollar</ins>

This year, I made Groople. It peaked at nearly 100 daily active users and through my efforts of getting people to play it, I learned a thing or two about marketing (though, not nearly as much as I would like). This year, I want a create a product that provides enough value to will someone to want to pay for it. It would be cool to be able to scale it past one payment, but at least one Stripe notification is the goal for next year.

#### <ins>Speak at a conference</ins>

This one may be a gimme or may be a bit far out depending on how I judge myself. Of course I‚Äôm going to speak at GrizzHacks, but I don‚Äôt want to count just that. Ideally, I would like the chance to create a meaningful presentation and speak at a conference full of developers. In my interview with Sentry, we spoke about the possibility of this, and it is something I would like to lean into and make happen either in my internship or personally in 2024.

#### <ins>Trying out Go</ins>

Go (Golang), for web developers, seems to be the common replacement for a Node backend. When a product is API first and a Meta framework won‚Äôt cut it, I‚Äôve found that most people now reach for Go as opposed to languages like Python or Java. This claim may be a little spineless on my end but YCombinator backed company job postings tell me that I should at least give it a try.

#### <ins>Full project with Next</ins>

Next (Nextjs) is this years Tailwind. This is the technology that I get shunned for not already using. Tailwind, however, I believed was the superior technology when I wrote my blog last year. In this case, I think even after learning and building with Next I‚Äôll prefer the DX of SvelteKit. Regardless, building with Next will allow me to better collaborate with others, help me draw more accurate comparisons between frameworks, and make myself more employable for the future. 

## Final Thoughts

This post is way way longer than the one for 2023. While I did broaden the topic a little bit, I do feel as though the length says a lot about how this year went. Coding became a real part of me and my personality this year and I expect that to only grow with me. I‚Äôm spending this summer in San Francisco, surrounded by cutting edge technology and the builders behind them and I look forward to meeting tons of smart people and creating exciting new projects. Until next year üëãüèº
