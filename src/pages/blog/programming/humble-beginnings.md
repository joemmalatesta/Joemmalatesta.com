I've always had an affinity for computers, just in general. From a young age, watching my dad troubleshoot Windows XP was fascinating to me
and it's incredible that a couple of on and off switches inside of a box can put me online, playing an infinite block game at 144 frames per
second. I've been able to navigate windows and do what I needed to as a user for as long as I can remember, but It wasn't until high school
that I looked a little deeper. In the 10th grade, a friend of mine introduced me to sneaker botting. I watched in awe as he bought up multiple
$200 sweatshirts that he then sold for $1200 each, all from his laptop at the lunchroom table. Seeing this, I joined in and upon learning the
ins and outs, the do's and don'ts, and the rules of the game, I found myself in the most lucrative year of my life. While the shoes I was
selling were expensive, the software I was using was even more so.

Sure I was making money selling shoes, but I was also paying monthly for software, servers, proxies, and information. The software I had was
limited, and each of every 750 users paid $50 a month to a presumed solo developer. I was making pennies in comparison to those supplying all
of these things to me. In the following year, I slowed down on buying these sneakers, and began networking with those supplying.


While my dreams remained in developing, my current knowledge only allowed for supplying information to others. With two others, I successfully
opened a group full of information and resources to 200 people paying $25 a month. This went successfully for a few months but, with most of
my work being during school hours, I couldn't keep up and left the group. I ended up selling my software and removing myself from the
community, with a renewed aspiration of creating my own software.


From that time when I stopped in 2020, I began learning how to code and, in doing so, found a new passion of mine. Over this past summer, I
finished two large projects, broadly expanded my technical knowledge, and worked at my college teaching students how to code and supplying
them information, just as I had before. In this coming school year I have lots of ideas I want to bring to life, and am excited to continue
learning in school. Perhaps, in this coming year, I will begin creating my own bot, slowly drawing the circle that will lead me back to my
beginning.
